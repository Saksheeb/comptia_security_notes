Categories of Security Controls: 
1️⃣ Technical Controls: The technical controls include a variety of technology-based measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), encryption protocols, antivirus software, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). They are meant to protect digital assets, networks, and systems from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.

2️⃣ Managerial Controls: Managerial controls are policies, procedures, and guidelines established by organizations to manage and oversee their security practices. They include risk assessments, security policies, incident response plans, security awareness training programs, and regulatory compliance frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA. These controls provide strategic direction and governance to ensure effective security management and compliance.

3️⃣ Operational Controls: Operational controls are day-to-day practices that maintain an organization's security posture. They include security monitoring, access management, patching, scanning for vulnerabilities, and incident response. These controls identify and mitigate risks to protect assets and data.

4️⃣ Physical Controls: Physical controls are security measures that protect physical assets and facilities from threats. These include locks, access cards, biometric systems, cameras, and security personnel. They are critical for safeguarding sensitive information and assets stored in physical locations like d

Types of security controls:
1. Preventive controls aim to prevent security incidents by reducing vulnerabilities and limiting the attack surface. Examples include access control, encryption, intrusion prevention systems #IPS, and application whitelisting.
2. Deterrent controls discourage attackers by increasing the perceived risk and difficulty of carrying out a successful attack. Examples include locks, security cameras, alarm systems, signage, and patrols.
3. Detective controls identify and detect security incidents that have occurred or are in progress. Examples include intrusion detection systems #IDS, #SIEM, #loganalysis , and #anomaly detection.
4. Corrective controls are implemented after a security incident has occurred to reduce the impact and prevent similar incidents from happening again. Examples include incident response procedures, system patches and updates, data backups, and security awareness training.
5. Compensating controls are alternative measures implemented to compensate for deficiencies or weaknesses in primary controls. Examples include additional security measures or safeguards to mitigate specific risks or vulnerabilities.
6. Directive controls are policies, regulations, or standards that guide the implementation of security controls and practices. They include industry standards like #ISO, #NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and #PCIDSS, as well as regulatory requirements such as #GDPR, #HIPAA, and #SOX. Directive controls ensure that organizations follow established security best practices and legal requirements.

Organizations can better protect their assets, data, and reputation from cyber threats by implementing a layered approach to security that uses understanding of above types of controls and includes technical, managerial, operational, and physical controls discussed in previous post.
